═════ TODO: Non-Prioritized ══════

• ART:  Find a broader font for the results popup (bold or black) to make it more readable
• CODE: Add a bounce to the results popup when it appears (tweening)
• CODE: Add system to increase difficulty after every X number of spawns (values to change... Increase speed of bubble and decrease time between spawns... also consider randomiziong between min/max values)
• CODE: Improve Progress bar: Add an extra layer on the bar to show the immediate change, along with a bar to show the more gradual change, this bar should lerp between values. Lerping value should also give a more smooth transition to the baby expressions.
• CODE: Clean up project and refactor code, split big script into smaller pieces... use encapsulation.
